6. As a creative you will see a list of projects in your profile for which you have the requisite expertise required of the project.
7. As a creative you can submit a proposal to a project

====Key Features
At present after a buyer lists a project they are asked to credit their escrow account. This is all handelled within the app using the Balanced API, using a JavaScript library for verification of the validity of the card and buyer details. 

The project can then have proposals submitted by creatives. Once a proposal is accepted by the buyer, the creative with the winning pitch is notified by SMS via Active Record Callback using the twilio API. 

A creative can see dynamic lists of projects based on their expertise and can communicate with the buyer through an internal messaging system.
